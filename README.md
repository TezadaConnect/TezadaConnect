# Terrence Calzada

Hi there! I'm Terrence Calzada a fullstack web developer. I utilized ReactJs and Laravel API to deliver complex web app projects. Once upon a time I hated javascript because of its strange syntax, when I got a software development job with react, I begin to appreciate javascript. Now not only for web but I also use javascript to make mobile apps with React Native and game development with Raylib nodejs binding.

## Portfolio

- My see my portfolio website [here](http://tezada-dev.herokuapp.com/).

## Frameworks, Libraries, Languages, Database and OS.

These are the frameworks, libraries, languages, database and Operating system, I utilizes in my projects.

- Javascript, C++, and PHP, these are my main languages.
- I love this frameworks! ReactJs, React Native, and Laravel!
- Raylib for game development and Express for api development.
- I use SQL and NoSQL type of database.
- Fedora! I use fedora as my main operating system!

At first I use Javascript in Raylib but i realize C++ is more powerful in games so I transition.

## What I do in my free time?

Well, I enjoy cycling with my colleagues and friends and if they are not available, I do game programming instead. I do play games back then but I realize that creating my own game (world) is more enjoyable.
